# Iteration.tools 
A easy way to support the [iteration podcast](http://www.iterationpodcast.com/) - This site lists many of our favorite tools / vendors. The best part - for most of these vendors - you get a discount and we get something in return. Most of the time it's just credits on our account, with some we may get a small kick back on signups. Also, feel free to just go use the services outside these referal links - a lot of great tools and services here.

### [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=8460460701) `$10 Off`
